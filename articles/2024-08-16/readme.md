# Rust `tokio::select!`

ü¶Ä 95% of Rustaceans do this wrong üò≠

The first problem is the most obvious one:

```rust
tokio::spawn(... // -- is not handled
```

Which is bad of course, but it's on the surface.

Ok, let's handle it:

```rust
let handle = tokio::spawn(async { /* ... */ });
```

Now we have a problem, since we have an infinite loop at the end of the main function, and we need to await our "handle". Where do you put the `handle.await`?

Here most Rustaceans

[ ] either **give up** and keep tokio subroutine just **unhandled** (which will sooner or later lead to disaster)

[*] or use mpsc channel (which is fine most of the time, but a bit too verbose).

There are multiple solutions. Most of the time tokio::select! {} will be enough. Because you can race your coroutines without introducing extra complexity with channels. While you can handle both: join error from the join handle and actual error from inside the coroutine in the same place with just a double question mark "??".

```rust
use std::time::Duration;

use tokio::time::sleep;

// this will stack in inconsistent infinite loop

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tokio::spawn(async {
        println!("control path (worker)");

            sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000)).await;
        }
        panic!("(worker) BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!");
    });

    // THIS IS BAD: main control path should be just a manager
    // since child workload should be handled
    println!("control path (main)");
    loop {
        sleep(Duration::from_millis(222)).await;
        println!("(main)");
    }
}
